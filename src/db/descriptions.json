The selection of these decisions is done using planning and expert systems. After obtaining the results of the simulated matches, an analysis is conducted with the defeated team, and a search is performed using the ant colony algorithm to find a better lineup either to win the match or, if winning is not possible, to obtain a lineup where the team loses by a smaller goal difference.","Inputs_and_Outputs":"Use lineups of each involved team and the evaluations of each player. If a player is a goalkeeper, they will have characteristics such as aerial ability, anticipation, ball distribution, saves, and tactics. The other types of players possess: attack, defense, creativity, tactics, and technique.
